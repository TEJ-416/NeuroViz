The code presented here is a visualization developed in C++ using OpenGL (with GLUT) to explore and comprehend the structure and dynamics of convolutional neural networks. 
This project offers a three-dimensional representation of neural network models, allowing researchers and developers to interactively inspect various components 
such as neurons, layers, and connections.  

In nutshell, the code offers a comprehensive framework for visualizing convolutional neural networks using OpenGL,
empowering users to gain deeper insights into the structure, behaviour, and functionality of these complex computational models. 
Whether for educational purposes, model analysis, or research exploration, the visualization tool serves as a valuable asset in the arsenal of tools for 
understanding and advancing the field of neural networks and artificial intelligence.
